/**
 * AI Transient State Bridge — carries per-instance UI state and active SSE
 * analysis across AIPanel unmount/remount during Pop Out / Dock Back.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 * When the user toggles between tab mode and floating mode, the old AIPanel
 * instance unmounts and a new one mounts. Most state lives in localStorage
 * sessions and auto-restores on the new instance. But a few things don't:
 *
 *   1. **Input field draft text** — what the user is currently typing
 *   2. **Collapsed table state** — which result tables are collapsed
 *   3. **Active SSE analysis** — an in-flight streaming analysis would be
 *      cancelled by onremove's cancelSSEConnection() and lost
 *
 * For SSE takeover we leverage the backend's existing lastEventId replay:
 * cancelling the fetch + reconnecting with ?lastEventId=N makes the backend
 * replay all events from that point forward. So we don't need to lift the
 * EventSource itself — we just need to carry the last seen event ID across
 * the mount boundary.
 *
 * Save/restore flow:
 *
 *   popOutToFloatingWindow() / dockBack button
 *     └─> switchMode(newMode)
 *           ├─> captureTransientState()  // calls the registered saver
 *           │     └─> current AIPanel snapshots its transient fields
 *           └─> updateFloatingState({mode: newMode})
 *                 ├─> body portal renders new AIPanel (oncreate)
 *                 │     └─> consumeTransientState() restores the snapshot
 *                 └─> tab content re-renders (old AIPanel onremove)
 *                       └─> unregisterTransientSaver()
 *
 * The saver registration pattern lets external code (outside AIPanel) trigger
 * a state capture without needing a direct reference to the AIPanel instance.
